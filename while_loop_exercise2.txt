1) Using while loop, take the elements from the [1,2,3,"4,"5",'6','c','d'] which can be converted to int and  add them together.
	Hint: use try,except method and check if the element can be converted to integer, if yes add them together. 
	expected output: 21
2) Using While loop print the fibonnaci sequence upto 100 numbers:
	Hint: make the loop run for 100 times(use 0 and 1 as default) and add the last two digits of the sequence.
	expected output.
3) Using while loop, take a string of all alphabets 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and print each letter in Uppercase():
	Hint: Loop through the string and convert the letter to uppercase and print
	expected Output: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z --(need not be horizontally printed)

4)Using while loop print numbers from -20 to 0 
	Hint: Start from -20 and go till 0 using addition
	expected output: -20,-19,-18,-17....,0
5) using while loop print the elements in the list with odd index:: List [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
	Hint:skip one index starting from 1 to skip the even indexes and print the element of that index
	expected output: 1 3 5 7 9 11
